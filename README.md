In this project, I successfully implemented a robust DevOps lifecycle for the company's product hosted on GitHub. I utilized Ansible for efficient software installation, including Git and Docker, and established a Gitflow-based branching strategy for streamlined development. Leveraging Jenkins, I created a three-stage pipeline: Build, Test, and Prod. The pipeline triggers automatically upon commits to master or develop branches, ensuring code quality and facilitating seamless deployment to production when changes are made to the master branch. Additionally, I containerized the application using a Dockerfile, integrating it with a pre-built container. This comprehensive DevOps solution enhances collaboration, automates workflows, and optimizes the product development lifecycle.
